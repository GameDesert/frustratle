Add a letter to the array if there are less than 5.

Update the output to show the current array at the current level.

	Backspace removes the last letter and updates the output.

If enter is pressed:
    check there are 5 letters in the array
    check if word matches,
    if not, check each letter to its position
    for every letter that matches, replace its position in the word with a star.
    once all direct matches have been checked, remove the stars and iterate through remaining unmatched letters to see if they appear in the target word (excluding already matched letters)
    every time an indirect match is found, remove that letter from the source word
